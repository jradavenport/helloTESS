# helloTESS
My first exploration from this amazing new mission. Exploring the short cadence (2-min) light curves for every Sector as they become available. 

## Plan:

### 1. Initial Search
Use simple/general tools to search each quarter for:

- starspot rotation
- obvious flares
- eclipsing binaries

### 2. Initital Catalogs
Make initial catalogs available to benchmark against. Publish anything special that arises. 

### 3. Improve Search
Ingest better tools, learn new tricks, etc. Re-run everything
